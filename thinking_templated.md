# Title
(A short, observation-driven title)

## Observation
What did I notice in real life?
What felt off, annoying, or inefficient?
Personal experience is welcome here.

## Why This Matters
Why this isn’t just a small inconvenience.
Who it affects and how it compounds over time.

## What’s Actually Hard Here
Where does this break down?
What makes this problem non-trivial?
What assumptions fail?

## Direction of Thought
Not a solution.
Just a direction, principle, or way of thinking about the problem.

## Thinking About a Possible System (Optional)
If a system were to exist:
- what signals might it rely on?
- what would it try to infer?
- where might it struggle?


## Constraints & Open Questions
What am I unsure about?
What tradeoffs feel important?
What would need validation?
