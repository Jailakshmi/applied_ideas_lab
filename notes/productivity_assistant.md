# Reconstructing Work Is a Cognitive Tax

## 1. Observation
At the end of the week, many people are required to fill timesheets or activity reports.
This usually involves trying to remember what was worked on across several days.

I personally struggle here and often end up writing a single high-level line to describe the entire week.
It technically “fills” the timesheet, but it doesn’t feel accurate or encouraging.

The work itself is already done.
The effort is in reconstructing it after the fact.

## 2. Why This Matters
Reconstructing work from memory is:
- time-consuming
- mentally draining
- often inaccurate

People don’t struggle because they didn’t work.
They struggle because memory was never designed to log work in this way.

## 3. What’s Actually Hard Here
During the week, people are usually fully absorbed in their actual work.

To fill timesheets accurately, one of two things has to happen:
- work must be documented in parallel, or
- work must be reconstructed later from memory

Parallel documentation is often unrealistic, especially when the work itself demands high cognitive effort.

Reconstructing work later shifts that cognitive load to a different time, but does not remove it.
In both cases, the cost is paid — either during the work or after it.


## 4. Direction of Thought
What if, instead of manually reconstructing a week of work, a person could click a single “summarize” button?

Such a system might:
- review activity history
- group related work
- infer what was likely being worked on
- produce a human-readable summary
- 

## 5. Thinking About a Possible System

This is intentionally high-level and exploratory.
The details would need to be reasoned about carefully over time.

There are already tools that passively track activity in the background (for example, Umbrella).

If this activity data were paired with an AI layer, the problem could shift from *recalling the week's work* to just *clicking a button*.

At a high level:
- the activity tracker provides raw signals of what happened
- the AI layer focuses on organizing and summarizing those signals into a usable narrative


## 6. Constraints & Open Questions
- How accurate does such a summary need to be to be useful?
- Is partial correctness better than manual recall?
- Should that tool be default summarizer or have a customizable prompt option from the beginning itself?
