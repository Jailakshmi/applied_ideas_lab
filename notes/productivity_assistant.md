# Reconstructing Work Is a Cognitive Tax

## 1. Observation
At the end of the week, many people(employees) are required to fill timesheets or activity reports.
This usually involves trying to remember what was worked on across several days.

I personally struggle here and often end up writing a single high-level line to describe the entire week.
It technically “fills” the timesheet, but it doesn’t feel accurate or encouraging.

The work itself is already done.
The effort is in reconstructing it after the fact.

## 2. Why This Matters
Reconstructing work from memory is:
- time-consuming
- mentally draining
- often inaccurate

People don’t struggle because they didn’t work.
They struggle because memory was never designed to log work in this way.

## 3. The Core Friction
Most productivity tools focus on capturing:
- time
- applications
- tasks

But timesheets usually ask for:
- outcomes
- intent
- categories of work

This creates a mismatch between what is recorded and what is later required.

## 4. Direction of Thought
What if, instead of manually reconstructing a week of work, a person could click a single “summarize” button?

Such a system might:
- review activity history
- group related work
- infer what was likely being worked on
- produce a human-readable summary

The goal would not be to replace judgment,
but to remove the blank-page problem that happens at the end of the week.

## 5. Thinking About a Possible System
There are already tools that passively track activity in the background (for example, application usage and time spent).

If this activity data were paired with an AI layer, the problem could shift from *remembering work* to *interpreting recorded signals*.

At a high level:
- the activity tracker provides raw signals of what happened
- the AI layer focuses on organizing and summarizing those signals into a usable narrative

This is intentionally high-level and exploratory.
The details would need to be reasoned about carefully.

## 6. Constraints & Open Questions
- How accurate does such a summary need to be to be useful?
- Is partial correctness better than manual recall?
- How much inference is acceptable without explicit user input?
- How should uncertainty be communicated to the user?
